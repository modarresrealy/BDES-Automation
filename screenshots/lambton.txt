Adam – Enrolment Advisor

adam@lambtoncollege.ca

I’m a huge fan of Breaking Bad. I mean, who doesn’t love a good chemistry lesson with a twist? If I ever went back to college, you’d find me behind the lens in a photography class, capturing life’s moments one shot at a time.

As an Enrolment Advisor, my favourite part of the job is seeing students walk through our doors on their first day and then again on their final day of school. It’s an incredible journey, and I’m honoured to be a part of it.

Back in my college days, I was all about The Den (our student pub and grill). It was the place to be!

To all future lions and college students: Don’t hesitate to reach out for any help. We might not always have the answers, but we definitely know the people who do. We love to help, and you’re never bugging us.

Avery – Enrolment Advisor

avery@lambtoncollege.ca

I’m a Police Foundations graduate with a passion for law enforcement. No surprise since I grew up wanting to be an FBI agent!

When I’m not watching Criminal Minds, you’ll probably find me playing baseball. During my time at Lambton, I got involved with CJP Safe Walk and even organized a charity hockey game between CJP students and the OPP.

My advice to future Lions? Don’t be afraid to ask questions – Lambton College is all about student success!

Brady – Enrolment Advisor

brady@lambtoncollege.ca

I’m a proud graduate of the Business Administration – Accounting program, and I’d take it again in a heartbeat – I loved it! If I had to choose something else, I’d go for Millwright. They can work anywhere!

I’m all about anything with two wheels, and I love the thrill of helping future students discover career paths they never even knew existed.

During my time at college, I got involved in Enactus, Student Ambassador, Work Study, and as an EBAT student, and those experiences made my time here unforgettable.

My advice to future Lions? Put yourself out there. Don’t be afraid to ask for help or new opportunities!

Rick – Enrolment Advisor

rick@lambtoncollege.ca

I’m a graduate of the Computer Networking Specialist program at Lambton College. If I went back to college, I’d dive into Instrumentation & Control Engineering Technology - Industrial Automation because it’s amazing how technology can optimize industrial processes and improve efficiency.

Favourite TV show? Jays in 30 – it’s the perfect way to catch up on all the action! When I’m not watching, you’ll find me indulging in my favourite hobby: collecting sports cards. It’s a passion that keeps me connected to the sports world.

The best thing about Lambton College? It’s a small college where we’re focused and good at what we do. It’s easy to get to know people, and there’s a real sense of community.

When I was 5, I thought I’d grow up to be a firefighter. Life had other plans, but I still love the idea of helping others.

Advice for future lions and college students: Take chances. Embrace every opportunity that comes your way and don’t be afraid to step out of your comfort zone.

Shawnee – Marketing & Student Recruitment Assistant

shawnee@lambtoncollege.ca

I’m a graduate of the Office Administration - Executive program at Lambton College. If I went back to study, I’d dive into something new and exciting!

Favourite TV show? Yellowjackets – it’s a wild ride! When I’m not binge-watching, you’ll find me indulging in my favourite hobby: makeup. It’s all about creativity and expression.

The best thing about Lambton College? The friendly atmosphere and the genuine desire for everyone to succeed. It’s a community that truly cares.

When I was 5, I thought I’d grow up to be a teacher. Life had other plans, but I still love helping others learn and grow.

My advice for future lions and college students: You’ll face tough days balancing academics and personal life, but remember, we’re here to support you. Embrace every moment, make lasting memories, and keep a positive mindset. You’ve got this!
