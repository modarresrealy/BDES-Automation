About Fleming College

Apply yourself where learning goes beyond the classroom and leads to real impact.

We’re focused on getting you career-ready. All our programs include opportunities to practice what you learn. Your programs might consist of labs, simulations, applied projects with community partners, field campus, work placements, and/or cop-op placements.

With nearly 100 full-time programs in Health and Community Services, Trades and Technology, Environmental and Natural Resources, Business and Information Technology, and Art + Design, you’ll gain hands-on experience that fuels innovation, sharpens skills, and sets you up for success.

Our class sizes are small, but the connections are big. The size of our classes allows you to get to know your instructor and classmates while forging meaningful connections with industry professionals through placement and field work. It’s easy to find your people here – friends who feel like family, services and support that help you thrive, and a campus in a welcoming and inclusive community that feels like home.
