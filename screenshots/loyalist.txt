About Loyalist College

In an impersonal world of big lecture halls and stadium seating, we know our students by name and circumstance. Small frees us to provide one-on-one attention. It means that our students feel like they matter. That they belong.

Small means that we can move mountains to help every student succeed, confident in who they are and what they're capable of becoming.

Learn the big benefits of a small college – and why Loyalist College students go on to do big things. Not despite our size but because of it.
