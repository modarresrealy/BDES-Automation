Joshua Dubois - Instrumentation - Instructor and Program Coordinator

Instrumentation is a trade, by nature. We deal with a lot of hands-on electrical and measurement-based equipment. But Instrumentation isn't always commonly known it's a bit of a mystery to some folks. I was always a kid who wanted to know how things were made or how to fix something if there was a problem. I took this program at Northern College, graduated, and then worked in industry for almost 10 years, and then an opportunity came to teach here. It's my local town, and I have a strong passion for the program. Since my time here as an instructor, I've really seen technology advancements integrated into the program as well as sticking to that core of instrumentation that we have a reputation for.
