Life at Niagara Parks School of Horticulture

The School of Horticulture was established in 1936 in response to a growing need for skilled gardeners to preserve and protect Niagara Parks’ expanding parkland along the Niagara River.

Today, as environmental challenges grow and urban green spaces become more vital, the demand for knowledgeable, skilled horticulturists has never been greater. For more than 86 years the school has been a leader in training the hands that will shape a more vibrant and sustainable future.
